### Hey! 👋

My name is **Xchel Diaz** and I'm currently a **Senior Computer Science student** at **Texas A&M University**!

This fall (_assuming it all goes well_), I should be receiving my:
- 📜 🖥️ BS in **Computer Science**
- 📃 🔐 Minor in **Cybersecurity**
- 📃 🎮 Minor in **Game Design and Development**
- 📄 🗺️ **International Engineering Certification**

I worked this summer for **Capital One** as a **Software Engineering Intern** and I'm currently learning about cloud computing and human computer interaction, practicing some Leetcode, and working on a _very secret_ project sponsored by **National Instruments**. I'll also be attending both the **Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing** and **Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing** conferences later this year!
