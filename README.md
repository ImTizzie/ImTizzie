### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Xchel Diaz** and I'm currently a **Senior Computer Science student** at **Texas A&M University**!

This fall (_assuming it all goes well_), I should be receiving my:
- BS in **Computer Science**
- Minor in **Cybersecurity**
- Minor in **Game Design and Development**
- **International Engineering Certification**

I worked this summer for **Capital One** as a **Software Engineering Intern** and I'm currently learning about cloud computing and human computer interaction, practicing some Leetcode, and working on a _very secret_ project sponsored by **National Instruments**. I'll also be attending both the **Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing** and **Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing** conferences later this year!
