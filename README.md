### Hey! 👋

My name is **Xchel Diaz** and I'm currently a **Senior Software Engineer** at **Capital One**!

I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2021 with my:
- 📜 🖥️ BS in **Computer Science**
- 📃 🔐 Minor in **Cybersecurity**
- 📃 🎮 Minor in **Game Design and Development**
- 📄 🗺️ **International Engineering Certification**

There's nothing crazy happening in my life right now, nor anything too interesting. This year I'll see about going to _Paris_ to watch the **Valorant Champions Tournament** live, as well as going to _Vegas_ to attend **EVO 2025**.

Otherwise, I like pretty much all the normal stuff: books, music, movies, etc. But I do _especially_ like video games and all sorts of tech-y stuff.
